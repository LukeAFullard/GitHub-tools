# GitDoco: Code, Issues, Discussions & Dependencies for your AI

A zero-install, 100% client-side web application that fetches, filters, cleans, and formats source code and issue threads from any public or private GitHub repository into an LLM-ready context file (Claude XML, Markdown, Generic XML, or JSON).

## Features

- **100% Client-Side Privacy:** Direct browser-to-GitHub API connection. Personal Access Tokens (PATs) and fine-grained PATs (`github_pat_`) remain strictly in memory.
- **Local `.zip` Archives (no token needed):** Click **Open .zip** or drop a repository `.zip` (e.g. GitHub's "Download ZIP") anywhere on the Code page. The archive is read in your browser and never uploaded: only its file list is read up front, and each selected file is unzipped on demand. Supports Deflate and Store compression and ZIP64 (very large archives); password-protected archives are not supported.
- **Landing page** (`index.html`) with a quick start; the Code tool is `code.html` (old `index.html?repo=...` links are forwarded).
- **Links out:** every issue and discussion row links to the thread on GitHub, every file in the code tree to the file on GitHub, and every package to its registry page (npm, PyPI, pkg.go.dev, crates.io), its deps.dev page and its security advisories.
- **Your own topic:** in Issues and Discussions, type a topic (words or an exact "phrase") to filter to the threads that mention it, plus related threads that discuss the same thing in other words (TF-IDF similarity). Related ones are marked.
- **Four Tools:** Switch between **Code Packer** (source tree packaging), **Issues Explorer** (issue thread triage & context packaging), **Discussions Explorer** (GitHub Discussions Q&A and ideas) and **Dependencies** (dependency licenses and advisories).
- **Dependencies:** Reads `package.json`, `requirements*.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `Pipfile`, `go.mod` and `Cargo.toml` from a GitHub repo or a local `.zip` (with exact versions and the real dependency tree from `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `poetry.lock`, `uv.lock`, `Pipfile.lock` or `Cargo.lock` when present, including workspace members), looks up each package's license, known security advisories and (for npm, PyPI and Cargo) transitive dependencies on [deps.dev](https://deps.dev), and groups licenses for review: permissive, weak copyleft, strong copyleft, restricted (source-available or non-commercial) and unknown. Advisories show their severity (CVSS) and title; direct dependencies show whether they are outdated, whether upgrading clears their advisories, and project health (OpenSSF Scorecard, maintenance activity, deprecated or yanked releases). The groups are a guide for review, not legal advice. Package names and versions are sent to deps.dev; nothing else is. It also explains why each transitive package is there (the path from a direct dependency), applies a **license policy** (allow / review / block per group, with allow and block lists, saved in the browser or committed as `.gitdoco-policy.json`), **compares** a branch, tag, commit or pull request with its base (added, updated and removed packages, new advisories, new policy findings), and **exports** CSV or a CycloneDX 1.5 SBOM. Not supported yet: Maven, Gradle, Ruby, PHP, .NET, Swift and Dart (the report warns when it finds their manifests). It never sees code copied into the repo, git submodules or system/container packages, and only advisories known to deps.dev are listed.
- **Discussions Explorer:** Filter by category and by answered / unanswered questions, then pack the question only, the accepted answer only, the answer plus the author's and maintainers' replies, or the full thread. Accepted answers and threaded replies are marked in every output format.
  - **With a token** it uses GitHub's official GraphQL API (about 10 discussion threads per request). For public repos a token with no permissions is enough.
  - **Without a token** it falls back to GitHub's REST discussions endpoints. These are not in GitHub's published API documentation, so they may change without notice.
- **Interactive File Selection & Issue Filtering:**
  - **Code Packer:** Interactive directory tree to select or deselect files and folders before fetching contents.
  - **Issues Explorer:** Multi-dimensional filters (state, labels, dates, comment counts, search, and cross-referenced `#refs`).
- **NLP Topic Clustering & N-Grams:** Client-side Web Worker powered TF-IDF cosine K-Means topic clustering and bigram/trigram phrase extraction for issues triage.
- **Noise Cleanup & Sanitization:** Automatically strips bot comments, low-signal replies ("+1", "me too"), images/base64 attachments, template boilerplate, and truncates massive log traces.
- **Context Chunking & Token Splitting:** Automatically splits large output context bundles into sequential multi-part chunks when exceeding a specified token limit (e.g. 100k tokens).
- **Background Web Worker Tokenization:** Offloads BPE token estimation to a Web Worker thread for seamless background processing.
- **Code Minification & Whitespace Stripping:** Optional code minification (Basic: whitespace & blank line cleanup; Aggressive: language-aware comment removal and full blank-line stripping) to maximize token efficiency.
- **Token Estimation:** BPE regex-based heuristic estimator matching Tiktoken / Claude token densities for immediate size feedback.
- **Multiple Output Formats:**
  - **Claude XML (`<documents>`)**: Optimized for Claude prompts.
  - **Markdown**: Standard Markdown code blocks.
  - **Generic XML**: Clean XML representation.
  - **JSON**: Structured JSON output.
- **API Limits & Pacing:** Uses the GitHub Git Trees API (recursive) to minimize rate consumption, respecting secondary rate limits with automatic `Retry-After` handling.
- **Zero Build Dependencies:** Built with vanilla HTML/CSS and native ES Modules. No bundlers or npm packages needed.

## GitHub URL shortcut

In any GitHub repository URL, replace `github.com` with GitDoco's domain to open it in the matching tool:

| GitDoco URL | Opens |
| --- | --- |
| `/owner/repo` | A page to choose a tool |
| `/owner/repo/issues`, `/pulls` | Issues (issues, or pull requests only) |
| `/owner/repo/pull/123` | Dependencies, comparing pull request #123 with its base |
| `/owner/repo/compare/main...feature` | Dependencies, comparing `feature` |
| `/owner/repo/discussions` | Discussions |
| `/owner/repo/tree/<branch>/<folder>`, `/blob/...`, `/commit/<sha>` | Code, at that branch and folder |
| `/owner/repo/network/dependencies`, `/security` | Dependencies |

The site is static: the host serves `404.html` for these paths (Cloudflare Pages, Netlify and GitHub Pages all do), and `js/not-found.js` sends the browser on. The tool then starts loading the repo, after the one-time notice on a first visit.

## Output Formats

| Format | Description | Extension |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Claude XML** | Wrapped in `<documents>` and `<document>` tags with global repository metadata | `.xml` |
| **Markdown** | Structured Markdown header with code fences per file | `.md` |
| **Generic XML** | Minimalist XML structure with CDATA file wrappers | `.xml` |
| **JSON** | Machine-readable object with repo info, file tree, and content array | `.json` |

## Getting Started

### Local Development

Because modern web browsers enforce CORS restrictions on ES Modules over the `file://` protocol, serve the directory using any static HTTP server:

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Node.js
npx serve .
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.

### GitHub Pages Deployment

1. Push the repository to GitHub.
2. Go to **Settings** -> **Pages**.
3. Set source to **Deploy from a branch** and select `main` (root).

## Deploying

The site is static: no build step is needed to run it. To publish only the site files (not tests or tooling), run `npm run build` and serve `dist/`. On Cloudflare Pages: build command `node scripts/build-site.mjs`, output directory `dist`, no framework preset; `_headers` sets the security headers. The suggested address is `gitdoco.timedoco.com` (see `PLAN.md`).

**Keep the host from adding scripts.** The privacy promises below depend on the site serving only its own files. In the Cloudflare dashboard, leave these off for the GitDoco project/zone: Web Analytics (automatic setup), Zaraz, Rocket Loader, Email Address Obfuscation and Browser Insights. Some of them inject scripts from the site's own origin (`/cdn-cgi/`), which the CSP's `script-src 'self'` would allow.

## Security & Privacy

- **Repository content is untrusted input to your AI.** Code, issues, discussions and package metadata can contain text written to steer an AI (prompt injection). Review the output before sending it, especially for private or sensitive work.
- **Secrets:** known token and key formats are hidden by default; generic passwords and tokens in code are flagged, and hidden only with "Strict". Files such as `.env`, private keys, key stores, `.npmrc`/`.netrc` and Terraform state are replaced entirely.
- **No tracking.** No cookies, analytics, third-party scripts, fonts or images; the IBM Plex fonts are bundled. Opening a page contacts nothing (except a GitDoco shortcut link that names a repo, which starts loading it); the browser only talks to `api.github.com`, `raw.githubusercontent.com` and (Dependencies tab) `api.deps.dev` once you use a tool, without a `Referer` header or cookies. `tests/privacy.test.js` guards all of this; `privacy.html` explains it to users and has a button that clears everything GitDoco stores.
- **First use:** before a tool first contacts GitHub or deps.dev, a one-time notice says who the browser will connect to and asks the user to accept the [Terms](terms.html) and acknowledge the [Privacy notice](privacy.html). Nothing is requested until they do.
- **What GitDoco cannot control** (GitHub, deps.dev, AI services, hosting logs, browser extensions) is spelled out in `privacy.html`.
- **Tokens** stay in memory and are only sent to `api.github.com`. Repository names loaded with a token are not remembered between visits.
- **Dependencies tab:** package names and versions (including a private repo's internal packages) are sent to deps.dev to look up licenses.
- **Content-Security-Policy:** every page sets a CSP that allows scripts only from the site itself and network requests only to GitHub and deps.dev. A `<meta>` tag cannot set everything, so if your host supports response headers, also send:

  ```
  Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'
  X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  Referrer-Policy: no-referrer
  ```
